# Data
## Describe
We will use historical and current **LifeFlight operational data** (including transport volume, patient origin/destination, asset utilization) combined with **external factors** (weather, hospital closures, demographic shifts) to train predictive models and execute scenario simulations.

## Link / Risks
The core data is currently available in a **SharePoint** repository accessible via Dan Koloski. The primary risk is the **complexity of integrating and synthesizing diverse external datasets** (e.g., population projections, weather data) required for accurate long-term **5-10 year forecasting** and variable 'what-if' modeling.
